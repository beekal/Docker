    "### 1.0 Image vs Container\n",
    "- Image can be  thougt of as a class while the Containers can be thought of as a object i.e you can create as many object from the image as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question** :  I do not want to download the big library 1GB each time from internet. How do I do it?\n",
    "Answer :  Download it and save it in the image. Not containers. Containers as in the case of objects are transient i.e whatever you do in a container will be lost once the container is closed. Hence you woul want todo any persistentthing in the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question** : So if the container is not persistent, how do I persist my output after doing some processing ?\n",
    "Answer : You can use volumes. Volumes are like hdds and are persistent.\n"

    "### 1. Download docker\n",
    "1. Download from : If you have windows home edition then you cannnot use the docker  in windows. Use ubuntu subsytem in that case.\n",

    "### BASIC Docker cmds\n",
    "1. `docker ps -a` # display all running and exited docker containers\n",
    "You can see `CONTAINER ID        IMAGE` . where container_id indicates object created from the image. This means you can create multiple containers from the same image as you would do for the \n",
    "2.  `docker run --name custom_container_name hello-world` # Run with custom docker name for docker container\n",
    "3.  `docker run -i -t --name custom_ubuntu ubuntu bash` # Create the container from ubuntu image and run the bash interactively it. Can execute all linux cmds here\n",
    "4. `exit` # Exit  from the container\n",
    "5. `sudo docker images` # lists all the images locally available in your computer along with the . One adv is that you do not need to download the images, if it is contained in locally.\n",
    "6. `sudo docker ps -a -f status=exited -q` # List all docker container filtered by status= exited with only the hash of the container  displaye\n",
    "7. `sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)` # Remove all dockers with the hash id as listed within the brace conditions\n",
    "8. ```sudo docker -i -t --name my_docker_ubuntu -v /home/bikal/Documents:/my_shared_folder ubuntu bash\n",
    "cd /my_shared_folder\n",
    "touch file_created_inside_docker.txt\n",
    "exit\n",
    "ls /home/bikal/Documents/  # observe the file persisted.\n",
    "```\n",
